Tabula Rasa is going to be replacing everything in the Toolbox whenever RimWorld next has a major update. To keep it compatible, the Toolbox remains while I rebuild everything around it, when the update comes this being all in a folder of its own will be a simple moving of everything in the folder, to out of it, once the Toolbox is scraped out. TLDR: Toolbox go bye bye, clean slate with Tabula Rasa.
