# -O21-Toolbox
Common Library for Outpost 21 mods, freely available to use as a dependency for others too. I'm open to pull requests too if you wish to contribute fixes/improvements, and you'll be added to the credits if anything is used.

For information on the useful aspects that you might want to utilise in your own mods, check the wiki page here on Github, though it's a little dated I'll try and keep it up to date. Any issues feel free to contact me on discord: https://discord.gg/sApZcRS

Disclaimer: I don't use version control as often as I should, after two years I'm still getting used to remembering to use it, so often my local build will be further ahead and the github build may be a bit broken in places. I'll try to avoid broke stuff as best I can though.

All of these people have been absolutely essential in learning modding Rimworld and their own mods are phenomenal, if you haven't already then please do check them out on the Rimworld Steam Workshop.
